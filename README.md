# To-Do-List
 It’s a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do. Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later. #stayorganised
